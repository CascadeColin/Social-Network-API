## Description

Social Network API is a back-end application that uses Node, Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB to set up functionality for a social media company.  There are CRUD operations for Users, their posts (defined as "Thoughts"), and reactions to posts (defined as "Reactions").  Users can also add users to their friends list and delete users as well.  
  
## Usage
  
This app is best used with Insomnia, an app that lets developers test back-end applications.
